 My TES3 Morrowind mods

## Ideas

### UI/HUD

- [x] Loading Splash Screens (https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51076)
	* Displays Splash screens when a (cell) loading screen happens
	* Screens are taken at random from the available splashes

- [x] Compare Tooltips (https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51087)
	* Compare tooltips for item
	* TODO: display two tooltips at once next to each other

- [ ] Immersive Realistic Maps
	* Disable the worldmap and overlay (optional) OR
	* When pressing M open a contextually-chosen map depending on player inventory
		* If a "Guide to X" is in the inventory, open the book
		* If a "Map bundle" is in the inventory, open the map
	* Crafting Framework: Add craftable maps from the books
	* Crafting Framework: Add craftable "map bundle" from books/maps
	* Tooltips when hovering over a city (taken from the vanilla books)

- [ ] Barbers
	* Add "Barber" dialog to publicans? -> Opens the/some character creation screen to switch haircuts in-game

### Gameplay
- [ ] MULE vanilla level-up screen add-on
	* ??? make MULE only level up when sleeping
	* re-add the vanilla level-up screen

- [ ] Better Vanilla leveling
	* Skills give level up points normally
	* optionally let minor skills contribute too
	* on level-up and sleeping:
		* display the level-up screen, but
		* disable player choice for attributes
		* all skill progression contributes to an attribute level up
		* handle luck somehow
	* Balance this ?

- [ ] experience based levelling
	* Replace skill levelling with XP-based levelling
	* Quests give XP
	* Kills give XP (optional)
	* Skill levelling givs XP

### Lore/Immersion
- [x] Bosmer Green Pact (https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51123)
	* change dispose of corpse to "eat corpse"
	* TODO: Ashfall integration
	* TODO: Hunting integration
	* TODO: better buffs
	* TODO: debuffs
	* TODO: better class integration

- [ ] Immersive Rotten Corpses
	* Change the name of corpses depending on how long they are dead
	* Change the mesh depending on time of death
	* VFX

- [ ] Ashfall hunting and skinning 
	* Field dressing of corpses (skinnnig)
	* Gutting/butchering of corpses (logic: make food quality/quantity dependent on field dressing, skill, temperature)
	* Add rotting (dep on temp, field dressing)
