# Immersive Travel - MWSE

A mod that adds real-time travel with smooth movement on striders, boats, ships, gondolas and river striders (with TR). The mod also has many quality of life features.

‚û°Ô∏è To start a trip talk to a Caravaner or Shipmaster and select the "Take me to..." dialogue option.

While on a mount you can freely move around the ships and river striders, or sit down and enjoy the trip.

- You always start a trip in a fixed slot
- The `W`, `A`, `D` keys let you move to different spots on the vehicle
- Pressing `S` lets you get up and freely move around the vehicle (only available on ships currently)
- Talk to the guide again to sit down in a slot

üí° Resting (default `T` key) while travelling lets you skip to the travel destination.

## Features

- real-time travel between vanilla travel destinations.
- smooth turning and vehicle movement
- random passengers on the vehicles with you
- companions travel with you
- various QoL features like
- different vehicles on different routes (small longboats connect the fishing villages, while bigger ships connect the towns)
- vehicle customization
