Morrowind thoughts 

> Hej. please look up the "thoughts system" from the game Disco Elysium and generate ten such thoughts for the game Morrowind.

According to the search results, the thoughts system in Disco Elysium is a game mechanic that allows the player to equip and internalize different thoughts that offer insight into their character's life and personality, as well as stat bonuses and other minor gameplay differences¹². The thoughts are acquired by having conversations, internal dialogues, or reflecting on events². Each thought has a temporary research bonus and a lasting bonus after it is internalized¹.

I can try to generate some similar thoughts for the game Morrowind, but I cannot guarantee their quality or accuracy. Here are some examples:

- **The Nerevarine Prophecy**: You have heard of a prophecy that foretells the reincarnation of the ancient hero Indoril Nerevar, who will unite the Dunmer and drive out the foreign invaders. Could it be you? Or is it all a hoax? Researching this thought will give you +1 Rhetoric and -1 Logic. Internalizing it will give you +1 Authority and +1 Suggestion, but also make you more susceptible to manipulation by cults and factions.

- **Corprus Disease**: You have contracted a terrible disease that slowly mutates your body and mind. There is no known cure, only a way to halt its progression. But what if there is more to this affliction than meets the eye? Researching this thought will give you +1 Endurance and -1 Volition. Internalizing it will give you +2 Physical Instrument and +1 Shivers, but also make you more grotesque and feared by others.

- **The Tribunal**: You have learned of the three god-kings of Morrowind: Vivec, Almalexia, and Sotha Sil. They are revered as living saints by their followers, but also accused of murder and betrayal by their enemies. What is the truth behind their divine power? Researching this thought will give you +1 Encyclopedia and -1 Composure. Internalizing it will give you +2 Conceptualization and +1 Inland Empire, but also make you more paranoid and conflicted about your faith.

- **The Sixth House**: You have encountered the remnants of an ancient cult that worships Dagoth Ur, the archenemy of the Tribunal. They are twisted by corprus and dark magic, but also offer you a chance to join them in their dream of a new world. What is their true agenda? Researching this thought will give you +1 Electrochemistry and -1 Morale. Internalizing it will give you +2 Half Light and +1 Esprit de Corps, but also make you more hostile and delusional.

- **The Great Houses**: You have become involved in the politics of the five Great Houses of Morrowind: Hlaalu, Redoran, Telvanni, Indoril, and Dres. Each one has its own culture, history, and agenda. Which one will you align with? Or will you play them against each other? Researching this thought will give you +1 Drama and -1 Empathy. Internalizing it will give you +2 Savoir Faire and +1 Interfacing, but also make you more cynical and opportunistic.
