# Immersive Travel - MWSE

A mod that adds real-time travel between the vanilla travel points. Real time travel is done along pre-defined routes on ships, longboats, silt striders, gondolas or - with the Tamriel Rebuilt addon - also on river striders.

‚û°Ô∏è To start a trip talk to a Caravaner or Shipmaster and select the "Take me to..." dialogue option.

While on a mount you can freely move around the ships and river striders, or sit down and enjoy the trip. 
- You always start a trip in a fixed slot
- The `W`, `A`, `D` keys let you move to different spots on the vehicle
- Pressing `S` lets you get up and freely move around the vehicle (only available on ships currently) 
- Talk to the guide again to sit down in a slot

üí° Resting (default `T` key) while travelling lets you skip to the travel destination. 

## Features

- real-time travel between vanilla travel destinations.
- smooth turning and vehicle movement
