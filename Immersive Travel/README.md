# Immersive Travel - MWSE

A mod that adds real-time travel between the vanilla travel points. Real time travel is done along pre-defined routes on ships, longboats, silt striders, gondolas or - with the Tamriel Rebuilt addon - also on river striders.

To start a trip talk to a Caravaner or Shipmaster

While on a mount you can freely move around the ship or strider, or sit down and enjoy the trip. Resting while travelling lets you skip to the travel destination.
